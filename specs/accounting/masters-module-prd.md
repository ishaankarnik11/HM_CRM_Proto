## Executive Summary

This document defines the product requirements for the Masters module within the MyHealthMeter CRM Accounting system. Based on the Accounting Module FRD v7.0 and actual invoice data patterns, the Masters module provides a read-only view of reference data used in the accounting operations. The module displays data from the existing CRM database for Corporates, Entities, Locations, Service Types, and HR Contacts. All master data management remains external to this system, with this module serving as a viewing interface only.

## 11. Data Relationships

```
Corporate (Parent)
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Multiple Entities (Children)
  ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Multiple Locations (Grandchildren)
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí HR Contacts (can be mapped here)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí HR Contacts (can be mapped at Entity level)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí HR Contacts (can be mapped at Location level)
```

### 11.2 HR Contact Mapping Rules
- **Corporate-level HR**: Has visibility and authority over all entities and locations under that corporate
- **Entity-level HR**: Has visibility and authority over all locations under that entity
- **Location-level HR**: Has visibility and authority only for that specific location
- **Multiple HR**: Same level can have multiple HR contacts with different functions (Benefits, Payroll, Approvals)
- **Fallback Hierarchy**: If no HR at Location level, system shows Entity-level HR; if no Entity-level, shows Corporate-level HR
