Difference Between Corporate Rules and Benefit Groups in Eligibility Module
Purpose and Use Cases
Corporate Rules

Purpose: Automated eligibility determination based on employee attributes
Use Case: Standard, scalable benefit assignments for large employee populations
Example: "All managers in Mumbai get Package A with â‚¹10,000 OPD wallet"

Benefit Groups

Purpose: Manual override mechanism for exceptional cases
Use Case: Ad-hoc assignments that don't fit standard criteria
Example: "These 5 employees on special project get enhanced benefits"

How They Work
Corporate Rules

Mechanism: Rule engine evaluates employee data against defined criteria
Assignment: Automatic - runs when employees are added or data changes
Scale: Can apply to hundreds/thousands of employees automatically
Logic: IF (criteria met) THEN (assign benefits)

Benefit Groups

Mechanism: Manual selection of specific employees
Assignment: Direct - admin explicitly adds employees to group
Scale: Typically smaller groups (5-50 employees)
Logic: Direct assignment without conditional criteria

Screen Components
Corporate Rule Interface

Rule List Screen

Rule cards showing name, eligible count, criteria summary
Active/Inactive toggle
Edit, Archive, Duplicate actions


Rule Configuration Screen

Criteria Builder: Dynamic conditions with:

Field selection (Department, Designation, Location, etc.)
Operators (equals, contains, between)
Values and AND/OR logic


Benefit Assignment:

AHC package selection
OPD wallet total amount
Service sublimits (Consultation, Diagnostics, etc.)
Reimbursement toggles per service





Benefit Group Interface

Group List Screen

Table with group name, member count, benefits summary
Create, Edit, Delete actions


Group Creation Wizard

Step 1: Employee Selection

Filter panel (uses same criteria options as rules)
Employee table with checkboxes
Manual selection of members


Step 2: Direct Benefit Assignment

Same benefit options as rules (AHC, OPD)
No criteria builder - benefits apply to all selected





Key Operational Differences

Priority: Benefit Groups override Corporate Rules

If employee matches a rule AND is in a group, group wins
Employee list shows "Benefit Source" column indicating which applies


Maintenance:

Rules: Set once, apply automatically to new/changed employees
Groups: Must manually add/remove employees


Flexibility:

Rules: Rigid criteria-based logic
Groups: Complete flexibility in member selection


Audit Trail:

Both track changes, but groups show manual assignments
Rules show automated eligibility determinations



Why Have Both?
The dual system serves different organizational needs:

Efficiency: Rules handle 90% of standard cases automatically
Flexibility: Groups handle 10% exceptions without complex rule logic
Clarity: Clear distinction between policy-based (rules) and exception-based (groups) assignments
Maintenance: Easier to manage exceptions in groups than create complex rules for edge cases

Example Scenario
Corporate Rule: "All employees with designation 'Manager' in 'Engineering' department get Package B"

Automatically applies to 200 managers
New managers automatically eligible

Benefit Group: "Project Phoenix Team"

8 specific employees (mix of designations)
Temporary enhanced benefits
Would require complex rule logic if done via rules

This separation allows clean, maintainable benefit administration at scale while preserving flexibility for special cases.
